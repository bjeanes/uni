;; NOTE (PLEASE READ):
;;  My documentation needs to be opened in OpenOffice.org. I run linux, and
;;  although I saved it as in .doc format, the deskcheck table gets corrupted
;;  in Microsoft Word. You can still read the deskcheck, but it will not be
;;  easy. It should be fine in OpenOffice.org. Sorry for the inconvenience, but
;;  I can't seem to fix it.
