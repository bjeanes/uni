;; Some Tests

;(text-cost "8" 16 5 "See Spot run.")
;; should return "ERROR" because "8" is not a number
;(text-cost 0 16 5 "See Spot run.")
;; should return "ERROR" because 0 is not a positive number
;(text-cost 8 16 -5 "See Spot run.")
;; should return "ERROR" because -5 is not a positive number
;(text-cost 8 16 5 7) 
;; should return "ERROR" because 7 is not a string
;(text-cost 6 24 10 "See Spot run.")
;; should return "ERROR" because we can't represent a character in
;; only 6 bits
;(text-cost 8 30 5 "See Spot run.")
;; should return "ERROR" because the number of bits per word is not a
;; whole multiple of the number of bits per byte
;(text-cost 8 32 1 "")
;; should return (list 0 0 0 0) bits, bytes, words and cents
;(text-cost 8 32 4 "X")
;; should return (list 8 1 1 4) bits, bytes, words and cents
;(text-cost 8 32 4 "XYZ")
;; should return (list 24 3 1 4) bits, bytes, words and cents
;(text-cost 8 32 4 "See Spot run.")
;; should return (list 104 13 4 16) bits, bytes, words and cents
;(text-cost 8 16 5 "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!")
;; should return (list 352 44 22 110) bits, bytes, words and cents
;(text-cost 12 60 8 "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog!")
;; should return (list 528 44 9 72) bits, bytes, words and cents
;(text-cost 11 33 10 "See Spot run.")
;; should return (list 143 13 5 50) bits, bytes, words and cents
